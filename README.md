## 💡 Project Idea

**SmartShield** is an intelligent cybersecurity awareness and risk detection system designed to help everyday users understand their digital exposure, risky behaviors, and potential security threats in real time.

The goal is to transform complex cybersecurity concepts into **simple, visual, and actionable insights**.

Instead of only protecting devices, SmartShield focuses on **protecting user behavior**.

## 🎯 Problem We Are Solving

Most people:

- Use weak or repeated passwords  
- Click suspicious links  
- Connect to unsafe Wi-Fi networks  
- Share personal data without realizing the risk  
- Do not understand security warnings  

Traditional security tools (antivirus, firewalls) work in the background but **do not educate users** or explain risks clearly.

There is a gap between **cybersecurity technology** and **user awareness**.

## 🧠 Our Solution

SmartShield acts like a **personal cybersecurity assistant** that:

1. Monitors user behavior (locally, with privacy in mind)
2. Detects risky actions
3. Explains the danger in simple language
4. Suggests safer alternatives
5. Trains the user over time using smart feedback

It combines:

- Behavior Analysis  
- Risk Scoring  
- Real-time Alerts  
- Security Education

## 🔥 Core Features

### 1️⃣ Risk Behavior Detection
Detects actions such as:
- Reusing passwords  
- Visiting suspicious websites  
- Connecting to open Wi-Fi networks  

### 2️⃣ Smart Risk Score
Every user has a **Dynamic Security Score** that changes based on behavior.

Example:
| Action | Risk Impact |
|-------|-------------|
| Using same password twice | -10 |
| Enabling 2FA | +15 |
| Clicking phishing link | -25 |

### 3️⃣ Real-Time Warnings
Instead of just blocking actions, SmartShield explains:

> “This website looks similar to a known phishing page. Attackers may try to steal your login information.”

### 4️⃣ Learning Mode
The system adapts to the user:
- Frequent mistakes → more education tips  
- Improved behavior → fewer alerts  

### 5️⃣ Privacy-First Design
- No sensitive data is uploaded
- All analysis is done locally
- Only anonymized statistics (optional) are shared
